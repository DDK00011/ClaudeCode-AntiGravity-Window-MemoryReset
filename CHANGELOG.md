## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-19

Initial public release.

### Added
- 5-stage memory reclamation pipeline: graceful close → force kill → empty working set → file cache trim → flush + standby purge.
- Win32 P/Invoke wrappers for `EmptyWorkingSet`, `SetSystemFileCacheSize`, `NtSetSystemInformation`, and the privilege-token APIs.
- Auto-elevation via UAC (skipped for `-DryRun` mode since it has no destructive operations).
- Multi-path Claude Desktop blacklist preserving the user's standalone Claude app across MSIX, Squirrel, direct-install, and OS-wide installations.
- Whitelist-based Claude CLI detection: Antigravity extension, Cursor extension, npm global, standalone, and the `--output-format stream-json` argument signature.
- Antigravity main + helper detection via `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Antigravity\` install path.
- Friendly NTSTATUS decoder for common error codes (`STATUS_PRIVILEGE_NOT_HELD`, `STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED`, etc.).
- `taskkill` exit code 128 (process already gone) treated as success rather than failure.
- `Test-Patterns.ps1` for pattern verification without termination.
- `Run.bat` / `Run-DryRun.bat` double-click launchers.
- Dual-language README (Korean + English) with reproducible reclamation result.

### Validated
- Real-world: 95% memory usage → 31% on Windows 10 LTSC 2021 (build 19044, 21H2) with DDR4 64 GB RAM, 101 target processes (~40 GB reclaimed). Run time ~15 seconds.
- Claude Desktop preservation: 9/9 PIDs preserved across all measured runs.
- API correctness verified against Process Hacker / System Informer phnt headers, MSDN, and Geoff Chappell's ntoskrnl reference.
